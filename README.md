# Web-Design-Challenge
Unit 11 homework

The purpose of this project was to take what was learned during Unit 11 of the Bootcamp about about HTML and create a dashboard to show results from a previous challenge assignment. In this challenge, individual pages were created for each plot and each has means by which we can navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. We'll also have a landing page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them. Bootstrapping was at least attempted although not covered during class.
